<p></p><p>According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>, about 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder.  The prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4% from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68) making Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>With so many people diagnosed every day there is much responsibility on practitioners to keep up with the demand and offer high-quality, innovative, and of course fun services.  Most people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders often show heightened interest and response to music, making them ideal candidates for music therapy!</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Music therapy is scientifically proven to help with communication, cognition, stereotypic and/or repetitive behaviors, social skills and interaction, emotional regulation, motor, academics, sensory, and musical skills.  Below is a wealth of research on music therapy and autism compiled by <a href="http://www.coastmusictherapy.com/" target="_blank">Coast Music Therapy</a>.  If you click on the + it&#8217;ll give a description of each article in further detail.  I hope that you&#8217;ll take the time to read a few of the articles and see just how amazing the power of music can be in the life of an individual with autism.</p><p></p>

Both groups engaged similar neural networks during processing of emotional music, and individuals with ASD rated emotional music comparable to the group of neurotypical individuals. However, in the ASD group, increased activity in response to happy compared to sad music was observed in dorsolateral prefrontal regions and in the rolandic operculum/insula, and we propose that this reflects increased cognitive processing and physiological arousal in response to emotional musical stimuli in this group.

Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context.

This is not normal Tennessee weather for February and has me ready for spring to come now!  Because I am not the type who loves cold weather I decided to switch paths for a day and write about an activity we did last spring to get us out of the cold weather blues.</p><br><p>I have about 30 different animal finger puppets.  The ones pictured here are a frog, cow, pig, and bumblebee.  A few years ago I found a felt barn at the $1 section of Target that has housed my finger puppets ever since.  The kids adore it and love putting the animals &#8220;back in the barn&#8221; after they are finished playing with them.</p><br><p>As you know there are thousands of animal songs to use with toddlers but because most of my preschool enrichment classes follow the school curriculum this particular day we danced around with our animal puppets pretending we were a participating in a barn dance with the animals in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barn-Dance-Reading-Rainbow-Martin/dp/0805007997/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank">Bill Martin Jr.&#8217;s book</a>.</p><br><p>We made up our own barn dance to <em>Turkey in the Straw</em> which is a classic American folk song from the 19th century, dancing with our animal puppets and friends in class.  There are many square dance moves but I listed a few below that I&#8217;ve used with the children before.  Be sure to keep in mind the age and ability level of the children in your music group and make the dance steps closer to each other or further apart if need be.  This will allow the children enough time to perform (and enjoy) a dance step before moving on to another one.</p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" align="center">Verse 1:</p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" align="center"> As I was a-goin&#8217; <span style="color: #800000;">[circle to the left]</span><br><br>On down the road<br><br>With a tired team<br><br>And a heavy load<br><br>I cracked my whip <span style="color: #800000;">[circle to the right]</span><br><br>And the leader sprung<br><br>I says day-day<br><br>To the wagon tongue</p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Chorus:</p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Turkey in the straw <span style="color: #800000;">[lock arms and swing with partner] </span><br><br>Turkey in the straw<br><br>Roll &#8217;em up and twist &#8217;em up<br><br>A high tuck a-haw<br><br>And hit &#8217;em up a tune called<br><br>Turkey in the Straw<span style="color: #800000;"> [clap hands]</span></p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Verse 2:</p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Went out to milk <span style="color: #800000;">[move forwards]</span><br><br>And I didn&#8217;t know how<br><br>I milked the goat<br><br>Instead of the cow<br><br>A monkey sittin&#8217; <span style="color: #800000;">[move backwards]</span><br><br>On a pile of straw<br><br>A winkin&#8217; at<br><br>His mother-in-law</p><br><p class="FontSize10 FontSize10 PurchaseOrders" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Repeat Chorus</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>The panel discuss Vanderbilt’s Council for Exceptional Children student chapter last week offered some insight but was far too short a time frame to be able to delve into detail about music therapy.  Thus, I thought it might be helpful to you and the students to write out answers to some of the questions I was asked in a longer format.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Due to the amount of information presented, I consolidated this post to where you can only choose to read the questions you are interested in.  Once you click the plus sign [+] a detailed answer to the question will show up. Enjoy!</p><p></p>

I started Musical Bridges in 2005 after graduating college with my music therapy degree.  I work with a variety of music therapy clients ranging from early childhood to the elderly.  I also teach music lessons on piano, guitar, and drums and do music enrichment classes for typically developing preschoolers.</div></div></p><br><p>Music Therapy is defined by the <a href="http://www.musictherapy.org/" target="_blank">American Music Therapy Association</a> (AMTA) as “the prescribed use of music by a qualified person to effect positive changes in the psychological, physical, cognitive, or social functioning of individuals with health or educational problems.”</p><br><p class="p1">When understanding what music therapy is it&#8217;s important to know several things:</p><br><p class="p1">1) It’s done by a trained and certified clinician.</p><br><p class="p1">2) It’s the intentional use of music to address non-musical goals.</p><br><p class="p1">3) It’s not teaching music lessons.</p><br><p class="p1">4) It’s not when a music lady comes to entertain the clients.</p><br><p class="p1">5) It’s functional and FUN…. best of all it works!</p><br><p class="p1">6) It’s a profession based on evidence that is gathered through scientific studies.</p><br><p class="p1">For more information on music therapy, please see my <a href="http://musicalbridges.com/additional-info/" target="_blank">expanded discussion</a>.</p><br><br><br><p style="text-align: center;"><br><div class="toggle"><br><h4 class="toggle_title">What is your background in special education and what led you to where you are today?</h4><br><div class="toggle_content">I worked at a summer camp in North Carolina for children and adults with autism for a couple years in high school that first introduced me to individuals special needs.  I auditioned for Governor&#8217;s School for the Arts (month long summer program for rising 11th and 12th grade students in Tennessee who study programs in music, art, dance, filmmaking, or theatre) on my clarinet the summer before my senior year.  The clarinet professor asked me what I wanted to do &#8220;when I grew up&#8221; and I told him that I was interested in being a physical therapist.  He suggested I look into music therapy and after that audition I observed every music therapist I could find in the Nashville area and fell in love with the profession.  I knew going into college that it was exactly what I wanted to do with my life and haven&#8217;t strayed from that passion to this day! </div><br></div><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br><div class="toggle"><br><h4 class="toggle_title">What does a typical “therapeutic session look like for you and a client?</h4><br><div class="toggle_content">All music therapy sessions typically start with a hello song and end with a goodbye song or activity. The individual is then engaged through musical responses. I use both instrument and vocal work to encourage changes that are non-musical in nature. These could include, but are not limited to, music improvisation, songwriting, vocalization with singing, lyric discussion, movement, and more.  The parent or caregiver is given feedback on work done after every session and the client is offered homework assignments to do at home to further progress. Data is collected during each session</div><br></div><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br><div class="toggle"><br><h4 class="toggle_title">What is your favorite thing about your job?</h4><br><div class="toggle_content">My favorite thing about being in private practice is having the flexibility to making my own schedule and not adhering to the structure and hours my boss gives me.  I also love that I can work with a variety of clientele that I may not be able to without the luxury of private practice.  For example, I get to work with typically developing preschoolers who bring such joy to my life and also teach music lessons.</div></div></p><br><p>My favorite thing about music therapy is knowing that I am changing someone’s life for the better.  I relish getting to be a part of even the small successes and seeing the joy on client and caregivers faces.</p><br><br><p style="text-align: center;"><br><div class="toggle"><br><h4 class="toggle_title">Do you incorporate any technology into your interactions with students/clients? If so, what?</h4><br><div class="toggle_content">I incorporate technology into each of my sessions in different ways.  Some of the simplest to explain are:</div></div></p><br><p class="p1"><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>: Spotify is similar to <a href="http://www.urgebasics.com/" target="_blank">Pandora</a> in that it has a free and paid version.  The free version is supported by ads and the paid service costs $9.99/month.  They advertise that &#8220;Spotify gives you millions of songs at your fingertips. The artists you love, the latest hits, and new discoveries just for you.&#8221;  What I love about Spotify is the ability to find songs that I want to use with my clients, create playlists, and download them so I don&#8217;t have to worry about not having a strong internet signal.  The difference between Spotify and Pandora to me is the ability to create playlists and also to find specific songs on the spot instead of waiting for them to randomly play on Pandora.  It has literally revolutionized my life to where I don&#8217;t have to worry about buying songs and connecting my iPod/iPad up to iTunes to sync all the time. Granted there is a monthly cost but it is <em>well worth </em>the price to me and I couldn&#8217;t imagine life without it now.</p><br><p class="p1">Bluetooth Speakers: I used to carry around a clunky iPod/cd player that plugged into the wall that I never wanted to get rid of because of the beautiful sound the speakers made.  Now that small bluetooth speakers have become affordable and sound good<em>ish</em> I use them in every session where I travel to a client&#8217;s home or a facility.  Most the music in my sessions is live but there is a time and place for using recorded music (with my Spotify songs).  I currently use <a href="http://www.urgebasics.com/" target="_blank">Urge</a> Soundbrick.</p><br><p class="p1"><a href="http://tapspeak.com/drupal/Choice" target="_blank">TapSpeak Choice:</a>  This is an app for my iPad that costs around $169 currently in the app store.  My older version utilized both <a href="http://www.mayer-johnson.com/boardmaker-software" target="_blank">BoardMaker</a> pictures and Pixxon symbols but they are now selling it with only Pixxon symbols.  The app uses these pictures to create very personalized, and (if you want) sophisticated communication boards.   I use this app with all of my clients who are non-verbal in various ways.  There are many free options out there if you want to use a choice board app for your ipad such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choiceboard-creator/id453988580?mt=8" target="_blank">ChoiceBoardCreator</a>.</p><br><p class="p1">Books:  I use books that incorporate music tunes ALL the time.  Here are some of my favorites&#8230;.</p><br><p class="p1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baa-Black-Sheep-Iza-Trapani/dp/1580890717/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424049666&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=trapani" target="_blank">Baa Baa Black Sheep</a>&#8211; Iza Trapani</p><br><p class="p1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Itsy-Bitsy-Spider-Iza-Trapani/dp/1879085690/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424049666&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=trapani" target="_blank">Itsy Bitsy Spider</a>&#8211; Iza Trapani</p><br><p class="p1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Im-Little-Teapot-Iza-Trapani/dp/1580890105/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424049666&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=trapani" target="_blank">I&#8217;m a Little Teapot</a>&#8211; Iza Trapani</p><br><p class="p1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sign-Sing-Along-Twinkle-Little/dp/1904550428/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424049697&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=sing+and+sign" target="_blank">Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</a>&#8211; Annie Kubler</p><br><p class="p1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sign-Sing-Along-Bitsy-Spider/dp/1904550436/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424049697&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=sing+and+sign" target="_blank">Itsy Bitsy Spider</a>&#8211; Annie Kubler</p><br><p class="p1">I make many games and activities that I use with my clients as well.

You need to be knowledgeable on both piano and guitar.  These will be your main two accompanying instruments and the two instruments you will have to pass proficiency tests on in college.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Get comfortable using your voice to sing since much of what you do in your music therapy sessions will be live music.</div></div></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2">2) Learn to pay close attention and notice things.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2">3) Expect that this will be a life-long learning experience.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2">4) Get used to advocating for yourself.  You&#8217;re going to have to educate the public constantly and stick up for yourself.  You&#8217;ll need to have some thick skin when people tell you that you&#8217;re no more than the fun music lady who comes in to entertain the clients and that you aren&#8217;t a &#8220;real&#8221; therapist like speech or physical therapy.  </span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2">5) Understand that you won&#8217;t be a millionaire.<br><br><p></p></span></p><br><p style="text-align: center;"><br><div class="toggle"><br><h4 class="toggle_title">What is one thing that you don’t love about your job?</h4><br><div class="toggle_content">One of the things that I don&#8217;t love about my job is having to constantly educate the public.  I love talking about music therapy to others and sharing my love for my profession but it does get exhausting to be honest!</div><br></div>

It will be held it on the campus of Vanderbilt University in the Kennedy Center.  I will be speaking about Music Therapy, Susan Lotz from Saddle Up will be speaking about Hippotherapy, and Blythe Corbett from the S.E.N.S.E. Lab will be discussing pediatric neuropsychology.</p><br><p>The panel presentation is for Vanderbilt&#8217;s Council for Exceptional Children student chapter (SCEC). The club is comprised of over 50 Vanderbilt undergraduate and graduate students who strive to provide professional development experiences to future special education teachers.  I was told that one of the ways that they have done this in the past is to have panel discussions that would help the club members explore different options in the field, as well as hear new perspectives from other professionals who are not their professors.</p><br><p>This event should be fun and interactive and well as very educational.  I&#8217;m hoping that a few of my readers can come out!</p>

I hope 2015 has already had a great start for you.  It feels like the holiday season came and went in one big blur.  I spent the week of Christmas in both Kentucky and Tennessee with my extended family and in-laws.  My husband and I left the day after Christmas to go on a cruise to the Caribbean which spanned over New Year&#8217;s Eve&#8211;it was fantastic.</p><br><p>Now that I&#8217;m back to my regular schedule it&#8217;s time to start thinking the direction of my business this coming year.  My main goals are to 1) continue to grow my early childhood classes, 2) establish a new contract in the geriatric field, 3) hire an assistant, 4) and finally to focus on creating worthwhile and creative content for <em>you</em>!</p><br><p>I&#8217;ve got some fun research articles and song ideas to share as well as some speaking engagements and presentations coming up that you can attend for free!  I hope this year brings you nothing but the best.  I&#8217;ll be in touch soon.</p>

        <p><a href="http://musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/image.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1699" src="http://musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/image-300x182.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="182"></a>On November 6th 2014, President Barack Obama attended &#8220;A Salute to the Troops:  In Concert at the White House&#8221; in which he gave a speech to salute and pay tribute to American troops and veterans.  Many well known musicians were in attendance including Willie Nelson, John Fogerty, Mary J. Blidge, Daughtry, Romeo Santos, and more.</p><br><p>In his remarks, President Obama shared a story of Captain Luis Avila and his wife Claudia.  Almost three years ago (at the time of the article) Luis was in his fifth deployment in Afghanistan when he was severely injured in an explosion. He lost his leg, fractured his spine, suffered two heart attacks and a traumatic brain injury. Two weeks after the explosion, he arrived in the United States in a coma and on life support. His wife Claudia had to make a decision to let him pass or keep him on life support.</p><br><p>Claudia had faith that Luis would recover and began praying for him some of his favorite songs:  Ode to Joy, military marches, and the Beatles.  In his story, Obama said that after this Luis began twitching his facial muscles, opened his mouth, and then moved his tongue on command.  It was during this time that Claudia played music day and night.</p><br><p>After Luis finally awoke he couldn’t see, eat, or talk but he heard the music his wife played.  In the months and years that followed, he kept fighting back with the help of hundreds of hours of music therapy.  The article doesn&#8217;t state who Luis&#8217;s music therapist was but only the success that today he can see again, eat again, and speak again. And every night, he still goes to sleep with music playing.</p><br><p>Obama continued to say that he honors Luis with the beauty of music because &#8220;it has the power to inspire us and fill us with pride, and, yes, sometimes to help us heal.&#8221;</p><br><p>I was blown away to find this jewel of an article.  To even hear President Obama mention that music therapy helped in the process to heal Luis Avila gives me such pride in our profession and an example that people are paying attention and recognizing our hard work and efforts to improve the lives of our clients.  I hope this article was inspiring to you as well as it is yet another proof of the healing power of music therapy!</p><br><p>Here is a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/06/remarks-president-salute-troops-concert-white-house" target="_blank">transcription</a> of the President&#8217;s speech.</p>
