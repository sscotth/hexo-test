        <p>It is going to be a great day.</p><br><p>WordCamp Nashville opens for registration at 8 a.m. today with the first sessions starting at 9 a.m.  WordCamp Maine and WordCamp Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal) are this weekend, too.</p><br><p>But if you are in Music City &#8211; a few reminders:</p><br><p>We still have a few dozen tickets available; walk-ins are welcome and we&#8217;ll be delighted to take your $20.</p><br><p>Volunteers are in green WordCamp t-shirts. Attendees will receive blue t-shirts. If you need anything, grab a volunteer.</p><br><p><img class="alignright wp-image-535991 size-full" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/05/flying-saucer.jpg" alt="flying-saucer" width="300" height="300">The painfully official hashtag is #wcn15.</p><br><p>Schedules are on your lanyards.. Three sessions are before lunch; three sessions are after lunch. We like the symmetry.</p><br><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-535989" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/05/logo_small_silver-300x202.png" alt="logo_small_silver" width="300" height="202">The nice folks at Lyft are offering one ride to attendees who are first-time Lyft users worth up to $20. The code is on your lanyard.</p><br><p>The after-party is at The Flying Saucer in downtown Nashville. You&#8217;ll get two drink tickets (maybe more if you know someone at the sessions who isn&#8217;t going) and light appetizers. Address is on your lanyard cards. We make excellent use of them and pack tons of print in a small space.</p><br><p>We have a separate room for sponsor swag, which is awesome because we have a record number of sponsors this year and a separate room means registration won&#8217;t back up.</p><br><p>And some random data just for fun:</p><br><p>San Francisco hosted the first WordCamp in 2006. Since then, there have been:</p><br><ul><br><li>470 WordCamps in</li><br><li>197 cities in</li><br><li>48 countries on</li><br><li>6 continents</li><br></ul><br><p>In taking part today &#8211; whether you are in Nashville, Maine or Portugal, you are part of something much, much bigger. The international WordPress community is generous, inclusive and growing.</p><br><p>With input from local organizers, WordCamp.org sets standards and guidelines to keep these grassroots events about WordPress, learning and sharing best practices and new tricks with the platform many of us know and love.</p><br><p>And please thank our awesome <strong><a href="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/sponsors/" target="_blank" rel="external">sponsors </a></strong>for making this all possible.</p><br><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-535990" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/05/Wordcamp-Color.png" alt="Wordcamp-Color" width="700" height="330"></p>

Attendees will receive shirts of another color. Photo by Morgan Bortz.</p></div><br><p>The Big Day is almost here! We&#8217;ve compiled some information to help make your WordCamp experience as seamlessly awesome as possible.</p><br><p><strong>REGISTRATION:</strong> We open the doors at 8:00 and sessions start at 9:00 a.m. Please don&#8217;t come too early. There is plenty of time to check-in, get your t-shirt, grab some coffee and meet some folks.</p><br><p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> The Nashville School of Law is located at 4013 Armory Oaks Drive, Nashville, TN 37204. The facility and parking lot are Wheelchair Accessible. Parking is ample and free.</p><br><p><strong>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE:</strong> Coffee and water will be available throughout the day. Lunch service is included.</p><br><p><strong>INTERNET / WIFI / POWER:</strong> All session rooms have stadium-style seating with individual power outlets. WiFi is available to everyone, but with many people on phones, tablets and laptops logged in at the same time, you may want to bring a hotspot if you have one.</p><br><p><strong>SCHEDULE:</strong> If you want a printed copy of the <a href="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/" target="_blank" rel="external">schedule get it here</a> before leaving home. The schedule also will be printed on the lanyard cards.</p><br><p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA:</strong> Please share your experiences at WordCamp Nashville on Twitter using the official hashtag, #wcn15.</p><br><p><strong>WE STAND READY:</strong> If you have general questions, a volunteer can help. They’ll be wearing the green t-shirts. Don’t forget one-on-one help with WordPress questions &#8211; be sure to bring your laptop to the Help Desk. We will have a team of rotating WordPress experts to help you throughout the day.</p><br><p><strong>GET A LYFT:</strong> Lyft, the paid ride-sharing service, has agreed to a partnership that gives first-time Lyft users one ride worth up to $20. The code will be printed on the lanyard card.</p><br><p><strong>AFTER PARTY:</strong> The WordCamp after-party will be in downtown Nashville from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., at The Flying Saucer, a literal Beer Emporium. We will be offering two drinks per attendee as well as some light appetizers. Feel free to invite significant others. The address is 111 10th Ave. S, Nashville, TN, 37203. There is (paid) parking available behind the venue, which is down a ramp and near the train tracks.</p><br><p><strong>GET TO KNOW YOUR COMMUNITY:</strong> We hope you love the sessions, yet much of what comes out of going to a WordCamp happens between sessions. Take the time to meet people and learn about what they do. You will not find a more open and available community &#8211; WordPressers are a friendly lot.</p><br><p>See you Saturday!</p><br><div id="attachment_535944" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-535944" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/05/wordcamp-nashville-party.jpg" alt="WordCamp Nashville Party" width="640" height="480"><p class="wp-caption-text">Join us again this year at The Flying Saucer for the WordCamp Nashville after-party.

I was just starting to get into web development and was using WordPress for my personal site and a couple of freelance projects. Instantly loved it and how the dashboard was set up compared to other CMS&#8217;s I had used.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>The community first and foremost. It&#8217;s easily one of the most giving and nurturing communities around when it comes to web development. From helping out small business owners, or development discussions on the forums or at meetups, the community is incredibly helpful and accepting. I&#8217;ve worked in several other frameworks and communities where an elitist attitude can arise, but I have not experienced that in the WordPress world. Also WordPress has come so far in how you can extend it for large scale websites. It&#8217;s an incredible tool to have when building for the web.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I design and build custom themes for different clients at Snapshot Interactive. A large majority of our client’s websites are built and maintained on WordPress, so I&#8217;m in the code for it pretty much every day.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>I learned WordPress sort of in tandem with learning PHP. My general mentality is to dive in and break things and see how it all works, and so the WordPress community in a sense really helped me grow my development skill-set. Anytime I&#8217;ve had questions about how to approach different scenarios, WordPress community has been instrumental in helping me figure out how to tackle it, and grow as a developer in general.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>It&#8217;s helped me grow my development chops, as well as opened a lot of professional doors for me. WordPress is widely used, and being able to develop custom themes has helped me find incredible opportunities I wouldn&#8217;t have had before.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>Have fun with it and reach out to the community. Whether you&#8217;re a new user, or a new WordPress developer it never hurts to try new things with it to see what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;ve hit a roadblock, more than likely someone has encountered that as well and would be happy to give some feedback. Also if you&#8217;re a new developer, the documentation is some of the most organized out there, take time to search and read through it and see the example code. Don&#8217;t be afraid to dive right in to the deep end.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should we know?</strong><br><br>Snowboarding is one of my favorite things in the world. One day I would love to do a heli-drop in Alaska! Oh also I love the Green Bay Packers and they shall rise to glory again!</p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>An employer in 2007 asked me to build his website in WordPress. I resisted at first because I preferred to build things from scratch.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like that WordPress has without a doubt (to me) the best publishing experience of any content management system, and that WordPress&#8217;s extensive APIs allow it to serve as an application framework.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I work for 10up where we build amazing web experiences for enterprise using WordPress.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>Local meetups and WordCamps have helped me learn more about the platform and introduced me to like minded people.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user?

<p>About 300 people who use WordPress &#8211; ranging from true beginners to advanced developers &#8211; will gather May 16 for WordCamp Nashville 2015.</p><br><p>The daylong learning and networking event, the fourth annual conference here, celebrates WordPress itself and the large global support community around it. A team of volunteer community organizers curates sessions, and this year’s event has more local speakers and local sponsors than ever.</p><br><p>“The big increase in local WordPress presenters as well as business sponsors is great for the community,” says Randy Hicks, one of the conference organizers. “It’s more evidence of the growth and popularity of WordPress.”</p><br><p>WordPress is free and open-source publishing software admired by fans for its ease of use, flexibility and ability to customize. The platform drives websites of major companies such as Best Buy mobile, TechCrunch and BBC America; to celebrity sites, including Katie Perry and LL Cool J; to single-author blogs; and everything in between.</p><br><div id="attachment_535698" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-535698 size-full" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/04/WordCamp-Nashville-2014.jpg" alt="Chelsie Goodwin" width="640" height="426"><p class="wp-caption-text">WordCamp Nashville 2014 Photo by Chelsie Goodwin</p></div><br><p>WordCamp Nashville is part of a much bigger picture. WordPress powers more than 1 of every 5 websites worldwide, including 100s of those for Nashville businesses. Each year, volunteers in cities across the globe organize WordCamps to share best practices and their expertise.</p><br><p>The Music City event, at Nashville School of Law, features 18 sessions in three tracks based on skill level, though attendees are not locked into any track. A daylong Help Desk includes other volunteers offering one-on-one assistance.</p><br><p><a class="button" href="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/" target="_blank" rel="external">Get Tickets</a></p><br><p>Expect a crowd that loves tech, problem solving, entrepreneurship and business. The event is entirely volunteer-run and speakers are not paid. WordCamps are run under the auspices of the WordPress Foundation, a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization.</p><br><p>Tickets are $20 and include lunch, a t-shirt and admission to a party at the Flying Saucer in downtown Nashville following the event. Lyft, the ride-sharing service, has agreed to provide a ride worth up to $20 to WordCamp participants who are not already clients. Attendees, including speakers and sponsors, will get the ride code at the event.</p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>My wife has been a blogger for a few years and she used WordPress. She introduced me to WordPress when she first started, but I began paying attention last year.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like the plugins and the community. I also like that it&#8217;s not difficult to get assistance if you have a particular issue.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I exclusively use WordPress to build all my websites. I also provide WordPress Site Maintenance and Security.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>Being friendly and anwering &#8220;NewBie&#8221; as well as &#8220;Difficult&#8221; questions.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Learning WP allowed me to create more complex and dynamic web-sites at a fraction of the cost it used to, because I no longer have to hire programmers. I simply find a 5 Star Plugin that does what I need and put it to work.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>It may be difficult at first, but stick with it, there are plenty of people willing to assist you like myself to be successful with the software.</p><br><p>There are so many training classes and tutorials on YouTube and elsewhere to really get you going if you&#8217;re willing to invest the time.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>I love Music and the Internet, I mean, what else is there?</p><br><p><a href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="external"><b>BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</b></a></p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I started creating websites for friends and bands in the mid 2000&#8217;s. WordPress became my preferred platform after a friend introduced me to it.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>Wordpress allows me to create something fully customized, from design through development, that also empowers/enables my clients to control and manage their content effectively. WordPress is a flexible tool, meaning you can make it as loose or as buttoned up as you desire. The more I continue to work with WordPress, the more I am able to abstract it and make it work for my purposes in a lean and intuitive way. It seems to grow with you, which is great.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>Nearly every project I design and/or build is run on WordPress. My essential tool for fully customizing the experience (both from a front-end and admin perspective) is Advanced Custom Fields. At this point, this plugin goes hand-in-hand with every install.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>The internet community is obviously essential &#8212; I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine how many times a thread or forum on wordpress.org has helped me solve a problem. Furthermore, the local Nashville WP meetup group proved to be the launchpad into my current role with Athletics. Had I not attended the meetup last September. I would not have met these fine folks who happened to be speaking that day. Now I work with all of the tools they presented during that meetup and it&#8217;s great.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Yes &#8212; it&#8217;s made me 100% self-sufficient through various stages of my career, either working as a freelancer or as a member of a team in an agency environment. It allows me to build what I design in a clean way, and it&#8217;s fun to collaborate with others who are also passionate about WordPress.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>Dip your toes in and don&#8217;t be afraid to break things&#8230;many things. It will get better with practice and experience, just like everything else in life.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>I once broke my leg in two places when I was 4 because I believed I was Wonder Woman.</p><br><p><a href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="external"><b>BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</b></a></p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I maintained dozens of websites for friends who were starving artists and musicians, so like all good developers I built my own CMS. When none of my starving artist and musician friends wanted to pay for it, I switched them all to WordPress so they could maintain their sites themselves.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>It&#8217;s so prevalent. It&#8217;s becoming a web standard, so it&#8217;s easier to suggest, develop for and contribute to.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>Full-time development.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>There&#8217;s so much discussed and written about WordPress online now, I rarely have a question that hasn&#8217;t been answered.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Yes! I was a full-time PHP developer, and got my first full-time WordPress job about 4 years ago. Suddenly I was dropped into the deep end, and had to <em>really</em> learn the patterns and best practices. Which lead me to an awesome community, a lot more work, and a new revenue stream.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>For users &#8211; have a clear intent for your site, and hire someone to set it up for you.</p><br><p>For developers &#8211; setup a site you don&#8217;t care about, and break things. Most people start because they need a website that matters, so they&#8217;re afraid of it.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>I also build non-WordPress web apps like WhatWeDid.Today, cronForWP.com and TimerDoro.com.</p><br><p><a href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="external"><b>BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</b></a></p>
