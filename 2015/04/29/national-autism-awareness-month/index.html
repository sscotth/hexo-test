<p></p><p>According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>, about 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder.  The prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4% from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68) making Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>With so many people diagnosed every day there is much responsibility on practitioners to keep up with the demand and offer high-quality, innovative, and of course fun services.  Most people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders often show heightened interest and response to music, making them ideal candidates for music therapy!</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Music therapy is scientifically proven to help with communication, cognition, stereotypic and/or repetitive behaviors, social skills and interaction, emotional regulation, motor, academics, sensory, and musical skills.  Below is a wealth of research on music therapy and autism compiled by <a href="http://www.coastmusictherapy.com/" target="_blank">Coast Music Therapy</a>.  If you click on the + it&#8217;ll give a description of each article in further detail.  I hope that you&#8217;ll take the time to read a few of the articles and see just how amazing the power of music can be in the life of an individual with autism.</p><p></p>

Both groups engaged similar neural networks during processing of emotional music, and individuals with ASD rated emotional music comparable to the group of neurotypical individuals. However, in the ASD group, increased activity in response to happy compared to sad music was observed in dorsolateral prefrontal regions and in the rolandic operculum/insula, and we propose that this reflects increased cognitive processing and physiological arousal in response to emotional musical stimuli in this group.

The findings of this review provide evidence that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in primary outcome areas that constitute the core of the condition including social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behaviour, and social-emotional reciprocity. Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context. Furthermore, in secondary outcome areas, music therapy may contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships.<br><br>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2014 Jun 17;6:CD004381<br><br>Geretsegger, M., Elefant, C., Mossler, K.A., &amp; Gold, C.</div><br></div><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br><div class="toggle"><br><h4 class="toggle_title">Effects of a music therapy group intervention on enhancing social skills in children with autism.</h4><br><div class="toggle_content">Seventeen children, ages 6 to 9, with a diagnosis of ASD were randomly assigned to the music therapy group (MTG) or the no-music social skills group (SSG).

In contrast, spoken-word perception was right-lateralized in ASD and elicited reduced inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activity which varied as a function of language ability.
