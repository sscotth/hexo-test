<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I can&#8217;t remember exactly when I first heard of WordPress, but I built my first WordPress business site a few years ago &#8212; and that changed everything.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like that the WordPress community is generally easy to engage and interact with. I like that developers have put so much thought and effort into great plugins, tips, and code that can be forked to extend the functionality and effectiveness of any kind of site. And I like that WordPress is easy enough to use that anyone can make minor changes with relatively little effort.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I use WordPress for most new site development.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>The WP community has been huge in helping me gain knowledge of &amp; confidence in everything from design trends, to SEO techniques, to server configuration. The Nashville WP community is awesome and the leadership team has been instrumental in creating what I feel is a very open &amp; accepting community for WP users and developers of all levels.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Yes. It has helped me grow my business substantially as one of my primary service offerings.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>Start following some authority sites and don&#8217;t be afraid to pay for the best plugins, themes, etc. up front. It will be worth it in the long run. And always keep a your site secure &amp; fully backed up in an offsite location (not on your server).</p><br><p>Users &#8211; Learn the basics &amp; be consistent in your learning. You&#8217;ll forget it if you only log in once per month. If you get stuck on something, just Google it. There&#8217;s about a 100 percent chance that someone else has run into the same issue and has a tutorial or forum thread about it.</p><br><p>Developers &#8211; jump in with both feet and keep a developmental site where you test new toys (frameworks, themes, plugins). Actively learn from other professionals in premium forums like iThemes Support, WPMUDEV Support, etc.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>Keep WP updated!</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>Several years ago, I started getting more and more clients asking for blogs. Then, as WordPress grew into a full fledged CMS, I was able to code more complex sites using it.<br><br>What do you like about it?</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>How easy and versatile it is! I&#8217;m able to create the most complicated websites with a backend that&#8217;s simple for the most non-technical clients to use and update. Combining WordPress with the Advanced Custom Field plugin means I&#8217;m pretty much never hampered by the CMS. I can do anything.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>The best thing about WordPress is the community that surrounds it. I can google almost any WordPress related question and someone else has already done it and has a free tutorial. That can&#8217;t be said for many other systems.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>My whole business is now centered around WordPress! Once I really began to enjoy developing with it, I realized that it was what I wanted to stick with, so I moved my services around to accommodate.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>For users: Every developer does their themes differently. The trick for an easy-to-use site is to find a good developer who codes their themes logically. Also, stay away from premade themes. They&#8217;re always a pain for both users and devs!</p><br><p>For developers &#8211; Chris Coyier&#8217;s book Digging into WordPress is still one of the best primers to beginning development.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>When not coding amazing things, I knit, run, craft and travel the world.</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>

        <p>The question isn’t why would you want to be a WordCamp Nashville sponsor. The question is why wouldn’t you?</p><br><p>Dozens of agencies in Middle Tennessee use WordPress to build websites for clients large and small. Such companies benefit greatly from a free and open source software like WordPress, plus the vast support ecosystem that surround it, and WordCamp sponsorships are a great way to give back to project that’s helped build their business.</p><br><h2>Three sponsorship levels</h2><br><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-177" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/03/sponsor-swag.jpg" alt="sponsor-swag" width="427" height="640">Sponsorship comes with goodies, which grow with the size of the contribution. We created three levels of financial support ($500, $250, $100) to make sponsorship more widely available.

Companies that sponsor WordCamp also get their brand in front of hundreds of attendees, including a ton of awesome developers, and prime exposure on this very website.</p><br><p>Technology companies have used other community-organized camps in Nashville as a way to recruit talent. We’ve even heard a few reports of local WordCamp sponsors getting new gigs or clients because of the extra visibility.</p><br><p>And don’t forget &#8211; additional sponsorship opportunities exist for the WordCamp Speaker Dinner and the after-party on Saturday, May 16.

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I first learned about WordPress when I started my own blog on WordPress.com. I wanted more functionality and learned about WordPress.org. I then set up an ecommerce site as my first site when i started my own business. I was paying another designer to maintain an html site for n=me and thought, &#8220;hey, why can&#8217;t I do this myself&#8221;? I statrted exploring WordPress more and loved it so much I decided to designing sites for other people full time!</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I love that it is so versatile. Not every site has to look the same. You can really flex your design muscles and experiment with different themes and looks. I also love all the plugins! You can really find just about anything you could think of to add to your site. If you happen to not find it, it&#8217;s not too difficult to develop your own. WordPress also has so many great support and documentation resources.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I now work as a freelance designer/developer and make WordPress websites for a variety of clients. I develop custom themes as well as utilize several different pre-built themes.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>I love Wordcamp Nashville! I have only been twice but learned so much. The Nashville community is really helpful as I have contacted other WordPress Nashville members when I need help, ideas or project leads.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>By designing WordPress websites full time I make more money than I ever have! Because of that, this year my husband and I are building a new home. It also feels pretty awesome when a client loves their new website or you have solved a problem for someone by using WordPress.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>Users: Make use of the WordPress documentation and tutorials you can find all over the web. WordPress is very user friendly and don&#8217;t let the fact that you don&#8217;t know a coding language intimidate you.</p><br><p>Developers: Explore and experiment. There are so many themes and plugins out there. Don&#8217;t limit yourself! The more you play around with WordPress the better you get.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>In my free time and ride and compete gaited horses! I have even done several equine business WordPress sites.</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>

        <p>Calling all WordPress fans &#8211; especially those from Tennessee (we count Southern Kentucky and Northern Alabama in that) &#8211; we want your session proposals.</p><br><p>If you’ve thought about presenting before but hesitated this is the year to try. WordCamp Nashville is soliciting proposals for three tracks &#8211; loosely defined below &#8211; and we need your help to make 2015 kick some butt.</p><br><p>Following WordCamp Central Guidelines, the Nashville organizing team aims to have 80 percent of presenters from this region. We’d love to see new topics and likely won’t select a speaker and session presented at another WordCamp in the last six months.</p><br><h2>Ideas to get you thinking</h2><br><div id="attachment_168" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-168" src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/files/2015/03/wordcamp-friends-300x200.jpg" alt="WordCamp Nashville friends" width="300" height="200"><p class="wp-caption-text">WordCamp Nashville speakers have eager, friendly audiences wanting to learn.</p></div><br><p>At past Nashville WordCamps, some of the most popular sessions have been on using a specific tool (like Gravity Forms) with WordPress or scaling a product into a WordPress-focused business (Ninja Forms). Security concerns haven’t gone away. Our WP devs are all chatting about Jetty and the REST API. Subscription sites are a big deal these days, as is WordPress and marketing integration. And WP users who aren’t developers always want to know what plugins they should use and how to figure out what is going on when stuff stops working.</p><br><p>We know you have ideas &#8211; so do it! Feel free to submit more than one proposal. Submission deadline is Friday, April 3, because we want the schedule set well before we ring the bell to start WordCamp Nashville. Okay, we don’t really ring a bell, the WordCamp Nashville is May 16.</p><br><p>People as well as topics will fall along a spectrum so don’t worry too much about where your proposed track might fit. We help with that.

All WordCamp attendees are invited to attend any session, regardless of skill level, and can switch back and forth between tracks at any time. Still, we put together these guidelines to help both attendees and speakers pinpoint where they’ll get the most out of their WordCamp experience.</p><br><p><strong>User (Beginner)</strong><br><br>A user can input text and upload media to construct a post. The user probably does not yet feel comfortable modifying code (CSS, HTML, etc.) yet to customize the available settings of a theme or a plugin. Is comfortable or getting comfortable within the admin and publishing content. Interested in learning how to use WordPress on a functional level. Functional level is defined as the following:</p><br><ul><br><li>Publishing content: pages and posts</li><br><li>Adding a widget, a theme, a plugin</li><br><li>Uploading images</li><br><li>Adding a user</li><br><li>Other</li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Super User (Intermediate)</strong><br><br>A super user is very comfortable with the wp-admin.

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I first got into WordPress in 2008 just after I graduated from Austin Peay State University. I had a B.F.A. in graphic design and no design job. I was connected with a local freelance designer who wanted to start building websites for her clients. We looked at Joomla, Drupal, and even (I think) a very early iteration of LightCMS before landing on WordPress.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I love the community aspect of WordPress. I&#8217;m a self-taught developer so it was very helpful early on that there was a place I could go to ask questions and get feedback. It really helped me understand what was going on with my code so I could start to move beyond just copy/pasting code into my projects.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I&#8217;m currently the lead developer with Ah So Designs here in town. I&#8217;m responsible for building all custom functionality our clients need. This can be anything from integrating with third party services like Instagram or Placester to setting up e-commerce and custom post types. In my freelance work, I&#8217;ve been focusing on custom plugin projects.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>Locally, it&#8217;s allowed me to meet and work with other developers. Being self-taught and working for small companies, I was always the only dev in the building so I never had anyone to bounce ideas off of to know if I was &#8220;doing it right.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also gotten connected with clients, and I got my current job through the local community.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Definitely. WordPress has opened up a ton of career opportunities for me. Having a design background along with the ability to code some fairly complex functionality allowed me to go full-time freelance for a time. Knowing that I can fulfill both design and development tasks for a web project made that transition a <em>little</em> less scary.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new developer?</strong><br><br>Use the codex, be ready to level-up your Google skills, and GO TO YOUR LOCAL MEETUP. And when you get to that meetup, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions. Anybody who knows more about development than you has been at your level before, so they know how it feels.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>Love dogs and have three: Lyla (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), Ellie (English Bulldog), Molly (Italian Greyhound, Lab, Pit mix). From Ohio but have lived in Tennessee since 2003. Huge Ohio State fan&#8230;deal with it.</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>

        <p>As a publishing platform, WordPress technology rocks. But what also makes WordPress amazing is the vast community of users, designers, coders, plugin developers and those many others who don&#8217;t fit neatly into any single category.</p><br><p>We started Faces of WordPress last year to highlight members of this global community who are based in Middle Tennessee. You can see the <a title="2014-faces-of-wordpress" href="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2014/category/faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank"><strong>2014 profiles here</strong>.</a></p><br><p>As WordCamp Nashville 2015 approaches, we continue this tradition &#8211; a second year makes it a tradition, right? This year, we ask you to take a few minutes to fill out our <a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Faces of WordPress</strong> </a>form, which will allow us to put together and publish more of them.</p><br><p>This is a great opportunity to show the diversity of our WordPress community and showcase how you use WordPress. The post will include a link to your primary site, your Twitter handle published and even a photograph showing your smiling or growling face &#8211; if you follow the directions within the form!</p><br><p>Please keep in mind the purpose here: Faces of WordPress highlights people and the platform and what it has allowed them to do. These are not advertorials, and the information you submit will be reviewed, edited if necessary and published by a person. Humor is acceptable; off-color language is not. A modest boast will be tolerated; overt promotional language will not be.</p><br><p>If you are reading this, you already are a face of WordPress.

        <p></p><p>Book it! WordCamp Nashville 2015 is set for Saturday, May 16, at Nashville School of Law.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>We believe WordCamp Nashville 2015 will be the best one yet. This one-day event, organized by members of the Nashville WordPress MeetUp, will have something for everybody. As past years, we will have three “tracks” to accommodate new users, intermediate users and developers. We also plan an expanded Help Desk, where people can receive one-on-one assistance, and small hands-on classes that require advance sign-up.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>You may attend any session, regardless of experience level, but we will break sessions into three general categories.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Tickets, $20 each, are scheduled to go on sale March 25 and will include lunch and a t-shirt. Subscribe to our mailing list to stay in the loop ticket sales and other announcements, including lodging options, speaker submission deadlines, speaker selection and schedule updates.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>WordCamp is all about community-building, and it takes a community to build a WordCamp. Submit an application to <strong><a title="become-a-speaker" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/wordcamp/form-session-submission/" target="_blank">Become a Speaker</a></strong> or sign up to help. It is not too early to <strong><a title="wordcamp-nashville-volunteer" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/wordcamp/form-volunteer-signup/" target="_blank">volunteer.</a></strong></p><p></p>
<p></p><p>This is the third year we will hold the event at Nashville School of Law, 4013 Armory Oaks Drive, Nashville, TN, 37204. The venue has awesome rooms, ample parking and easy access from both Interstates 65 and 24.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>So mark the date. May 16, 2015. Nashville WordCamp returns.</p><p></p>
<p></p><h2>BECOME A SPEAKER</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Wanted: WordCamp speakers who understand what WordPress users and developers want and need and can communicate it clearly. Because we want to showcase the depth of talent in Greater Nashville, preference will be given to local speakers who have not presented at other WordCamps.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong><a title="nashville-session-submission" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/wordcamp/form-session-submission/" target="_blank">Submit a speaker application.</a></strong></p><p></p>
<p></p><h2>BECOME A VOLUNTEER</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Without volunteers we are nothing!</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Months of planning and preparation come down to 8 hours on a Saturday in May, and a cadre of awesome volunteers makes the event run smoothly. WIth enough volunteers, we can make sure they also can attend some sessions. The day of the event we’ll need help with registration, room monitoring, coffee set-up, lunch distribution and clean-up.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>We can’t comp volunteer tickets but we will show our appreciation in other ways.</p><p></p>
