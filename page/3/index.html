After the degree program at Tennessee Technological University ended students haven&#8217;t had an opportunity to attend a Tennessee college.  Starting in the fall of 2014, Belmont is adding music therapy as a new degree offered! </p><br><p>According to Dr. Madeline Bridges, the Associate Dean for Academic Studies, “a major in music therapy has been a dream for our School of Music faculty for a decade, particularly with our focus on education and nurturing through the arts. Add in the healthcare opportunities present in Nashville and the region, and this new program is a perfect fit for Belmont and the broader community.”</p><br><p>Belmont&#8217;s <a href="http://forum.belmont.edu/news/2014/04/03/belmont-adds-new-majors-in-music-therapy-publishing-for-fall-2014/" target="_blank">website</a> states that the music therapy program is the only one of its kind in the state and will be very rigorous. Students will need a total of 136 hours including the required 41 BELL Core general education hours, 79 music hours, 20 hours of music therapy courses and an additional 13 clinical foundations courses. In addition, the program will require a six-month internship, often outside of Nashville. Once complete, the degree will qualify graduates to sit for the board certification exam.</p><br><p>I am thrilled to see this change for my home state.  I look forward to getting to know all of the new therapists this degree program will bring the great state of Tennessee! </p>

        <p>I love getting to sing Easter songs around the holiday.  Some of our favorites include an Easter egg hunt using music eggs, jelly bean color matching, and hopping like a bunny in silly ways such as fast/slow, forwards/backwards.  This year we did a new dance pretending to be bunnies. This song works on counting, turn taking, pretend play, and group participation to name a few.  Hopefully you&#8217;ll try this one out too.  It&#8217;s already become a favorite! </p><br><p>There were six little bunnies a-sittin&#8217; on a hill (sit down in a circle)<br><br>Six little bunnies were oh-so still<br><br>They sniffed the air (sniff nose)<br><br>And one hopped away (teacher points to one student to hop away)<br><br>How many bunnies were left to play?</p><br><p>Continue with the remainder of students that are in the group.  Have the children who &#8220;hopped away&#8221; be special helpers to count.</p><br><p><a href="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17-10.40.06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1447" src="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17-10.40.06-225x300.jpg" alt="Easter Fun" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

I&#8217;ve always considered autism to be my speciality as a music therapist and see first hand the benefits music has with those on the spectrum.</p><br><p>According to the <a title="Autism Society of America" href="http://www.autism-society.org/" target="_blank">Autism Society of America</a>, autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and affects a person’s ability to communicate and interact with others. Autism is defined by a certain set of behaviors and is a “spectrum disorder” that affects individuals differently and to varying degrees.</p><br><p>Music and autism research support the benefits of music and the positive effects music therapy has in the treatment of individuals with autism.  According to the <a title="AMTA" href="http://www.musictherapy.org/" target="_blank">American Music Therapy Association</a> music can address communication, cognition, behaviors (problem/repetitive/stereotypic), social skills and interactions, as well as regulate emotions.</p><br><p>Individuals with autism show equal or superior abilities in pitch processing, labeling of emotions in music, and musical preference when compared to typically developing peers.  Most have innate musical talents; thus, music therapy provides an opportunity for successful experiences.  Musical elements and structures provide a sense of security and familiarity in the music therapy setting, encouraging individuals with autism to attempt new tasks in a predictable framework.  Because music is processed in both hemispheres of the brain, it can stimulate cognitive functioning and be used for remediation of some speech skills.</p><br><p>The results of music therapy for those diagnosed with autism is widespread.  I hope to learn even more about those with autism through my continued work in them.  Feel free to call or fill out an contact form to discuss my available services in this field.</p>

In Chicago, I ate every kind of Chicago style pizza there is (literally almost every meal!) and got to explore the vibrant downtown life. There was even a jazz and blues music festival going on!

        <p>On a recent trip to Chicago I saw a Yoga magazine from June 2013 in my hotel room and decided to take a look for some inspiration since I practice yoga a couple times a week. One article I found was particularly interesting because it spoke of yoga for children on the autism spectrum. The article is by Mira Binzen and she states that the subtle decor, dim lights, clutter-free space, and pleasant room smells can be an ideal setting for children on the autism spectrum.  This spectrum includes Asperger Syndrome and PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder- not otherwise specified).  One hallmark of children on the spectrum is to have sensory processing issues, and this is where yoga can be helpful.  It can help the children self-soothe, self-regulate, gain confidence, and socialize more effectively.  Yoga also can reduce stress, and this in turn can reduce stereotypical/self-stimulating behaviors Binzen writes.</p><br><p>The article goes on to list ways yoga teachers can provide a comfortable and effective practice for children on the autism spectrum.  One of my favorite ideas from Binzen is to have the children partner up.  Some children with autism can be highly adverse to physical contact with others and yoga can provide an opportunity for the children to practice social skills while doing partnering poses.  She also mentions mirroring another without physical contact to help enhance socialization skills.</p><br><p>Mirroring is a technique I use in my music therapy practice with children on the autism spectrum (and others as well!).  Music making activities involving imitation and synchronization have the ability to engage regions of the brain that presumably contains &#8220;mirror neurons&#8221;, making music activities particularly useful for the treatment of developmental disorders and autism.<a href="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kids-yoga2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img class="wp-image-1366 alignright" alt="kids-yoga" src="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kids-yoga2-1024x512.jpg" width="614" height="307"></a></p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>I love and relish in any opportunity to incorporate some fun props into my preschool music enrichment classes.  This week we&#8217;re celebrating the Fourth of July holiday.  The little boy to the right is displaying the flags we use during the &#8220;Wave Your Flag&#8221; song.  The words are:</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Wave, wave, wave the flag</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Hold it very high</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Watch the colors gently wave</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Way up in the sky</p><p></p>
<div>After we practice waving our flags, I give the children other directions such as &#8220;March, march, march around, Hold the flag up high&#8230;&#8221;  I always ask the children how they&#8217;d like to move and hear variations such as hop, spin, fly, crawl, etc.   This song is a great way to get the children up and moving while still working on following 1-step directions and expanding their movement vocabulary.  I hope you enjoy this song as much as we do.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Happy Fourth of July!</div>

Some of the babies receiving music therapy actually got to leave the hospitals a couple of days sooner than those babies not receiving music therapy which not only saved the families money but also allowed them additional time to bond with their family.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Even though I don&#8217;t currently work with preterm babies, you and I can apply some of the same principles music therapists in hospitals use to our own lives.  One thing I&#8217;m always told when I go to the doctor is that I don&#8217;t breathe deeply and steadily.  When I get massages they always complain about the same thing.  I&#8217;m one of those people whose mind is always running a million miles a minute and it&#8217;s hard to turn it all off.  It&#8217;s difficult for me to focus on breathing but it is so vital to our health and ability to relax.  Just like with infants, meaningful music can help adults decrease our stress responses and aid in sleep.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">I&#8217;m putting my words to practice as I&#8217;m writing this blog post, listening to a &#8220;ocean waves&#8221; station on Pandora.   If you find yourself stressed or feeling tense, remember that music can calm the heartbeat and soothe the soul.  Try to listen to music and breathe deeply and purposefully.   Just with the infants, align your heartbeat with the slow tempo of a relaxing song.</p><p></p>

        <p>Last night I attended the Autism Society of Middle Tennessee&#8217;s summer opportunities fair.  I loved meeting new families and networking with other professionals in the field.  Thank you ASMT for all of the hard work you do for the Nashville community.  I&#8217;ll look forward to next year&#8217;s event!<a href="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-28-17.23.06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1307" alt="My booth" src="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-28-17.23.06-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461"></a></p>
