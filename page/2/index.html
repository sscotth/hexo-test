It was written by Jennifer Peter, AMTA Communications Associate, and Al Bumanis, AMTA Director of Communications.</p><br><p>The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) supports music for all and applauds the efforts of individuals who share their musicmaking and time; we say the more music the better! But clinical music therapy is the only professional, research-based discipline that actively applies supportive science to the creative, emotional, and energizing experiences of music for health treatment and educational goals.</p><br><p>Below are a few important facts about music therapy and the credentialed music therapists who practice it:</p><br><ul><br><li>Music therapists must have a bachelor’s degree or higher in music therapy from one of AMTA’s 72 approved colleges and universities, including 1200 hours of clinical training.</li><br><li>Music therapists must hold the MT-BC credential, issued through the Certification Board for Music Therapists, which protects the public by ensuring competent practice and requiring continuing education. Some states also require licensure for board-certified music therapists.</li><br><li>Music Therapy is an evidence-based health profession with a strong research foundation.</li><br><li>Music Therapy degrees require knowledge in psychology, medicine, and music.</li><br></ul><br><p>These examples of therapeutic music are noteworthy, but are not clinical music therapy:</p><br><ul><br><li>A person with Alzheimer’s listening to an iPod with headphones of his/her favorite songs</li><br><li>Groups such as Bedside Musicians, Musicians on Call, Music Practitioners, Sound Healers, and Music Thanatologists</li><br><li>Celebrities performing at hospitals and/or schools</li><br><li>A piano player in the lobby of a hospital</li><br><li>Nurses playing background music for patients</li><br><li>Artists in residence</li><br><li>Arts educators</li><br><li>A high school student playing guitar in a nursing home</li><br><li>A choir singing on the pediatric floor of a hospital</li><br></ul><br><p>Finally, here are examples what credentialed music therapists do:</p><br><ul><br><li>Work with Congresswoman Giffords to regain her speech after surviving a bullet wound to her brain.</li><br><li>Work with older adults to lessen the effects of dementia.</li><br><li>Work with children and adults to reduce asthma episodes.</li><br><li>Work with hospitalized patients to reduce pain.</li><br><li>Work with children who have autism to improve communication capabilities.</li><br><li>Work with premature infants to improve sleep patterns and increase weight gain.</li><br><li>Work with people who have Parkinson’s disease to improve motor function.</li><br></ul><br><p>AMTA’s mission is to advance public awareness of the benefits of music therapy and increase access to quality music therapy services in a rapidly changing world. In consideration of the diversity of music used in healthcare, special education, and other settings, AMTA unequivocally recommends the unique knowledge and skill of board certified music therapists.</p><br><p>For more information on this topic please visit the American Music Therapy Association at www.musictherapy.org and click on the Research tab.</p>

        <p>One of the skills I work on with my clients is understanding different seasons and holidays.  For example, I make sure they comprehend that we wear short and flipflops in the summer instead of the winter and why.  A fun topic to explore is various foods that match holidays traditions.  Thanksgiving is one of the holidays that has a very specific set of foods most families eat.  I use the song below to challenge the children to think of foods that we eat during the Thanksgiving holiday.  I substitute the bolded names for whoever is answering the question and the bolded foods for their choice.</p><br><p>Song:</p><br><p>Let&#8217;s eat our dinner our holiday dinner Thanksgiving day is here!</p><br><p>The <strong>turkey and dressing </strong>looks good to <strong>Melissa</strong></p><br><p>Let&#8217;s put it on the table</p><br><p>Let&#8217;s eat our dinner our holiday dinner Thanksgiving day is here!</p><br><p>The <b>pumpkin pie </b>looks good to <strong>Sally</strong></p><br><p>Hooray for Thanksgiving day</p><br><p>For non-verbal and younger children I show them a choice board to pick a food from.  The software I use to create my choice boards is <a href="http://www.mayer-johnson.com/boardmaker-software/" target="_blank">Boardmaker</a>.   An example from their website is below which includes food in general.  Mine is specific to Thanksgiving.  While Boardmaker is an excellent program it can be costly.  Many free and lost cost solutions are available if you are interested in making your own choice boards such as <a href="https://openclipart.org/" target="_blank">openclipart</a> and <a href="http://classroomclipart.com/" target="_blank">classroom clipart </a>.</p><br><p><a href="http://musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/food-boardmaker.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1682 size-medium" src="http://musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/food-boardmaker-300x225.jpg" alt="food boardmaker" width="300" height="225"></a></p><br><p>I hope you enjoy my Thanksgiving foods song and give it a try yourself!</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>This blog post is the fourth in a four part series discussing the benefits of Suzuki piano. <a href="http://musicalbridges.com/?p=1609" target="_blank">Part one</a> examined the importance of music training and the role it plays in brain development. <a href="http://musicalbridges.com/?p=1642" target="_blank">Part two</a> gave a short biography of <span style="color: #000000;">Shinichi Suzuki. </span><a href="http://musicalbridges.com/?p=1624" target="_blank">Part three</a> provided an overview of the Suzuki piano method.  Today I hope to give you, the music teacher, some valuable tips to help you have more confidence and success teaching Suzuki piano to children.</p><br><p><strong>1) Encourage parental involvement</strong><br><br>It is vital that the parent understand what is needed from them as a home teacher/practice assistant. It is by no means required that the parent have any past experience with music, and because of that, it is important that you have the ability to help them be an effective assistant at home. Ask the parents to come to lessons, take notes, and participate as much as possible. Many of the parents of students I teach find it exciting to get to learn alongside their child- who doesn&#8217;t like &#8220;free&#8221; lessons! I have parents clap rhythms alongside their child and even play the notes on the piano if desired. I stress to parents that constant repetition is essential in learning to play an instrument, especially for a young child and that I need their help at home to reinforce this.</p><br><p><strong>2) Detailed instructions for practice sessions</strong><br><br>One of the biggest and most challenging responsibilities as a teacher is to teach their students how to practice. I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that I do not give very specific, detailed instruction of what to practice at home that the child comes back to their next lesson with little to no improvement. This includes not only what to practice but how to practice as well. After I assess how well a child is grasping what I am teaching them, I suggest work on the entire song but also on the trouble areas. For very small children, I give them a specific number of times to play the challenging sections and leave it up to the parent how many times they need to play through the song as a whole. The length of practice time will vary from student to student but the common denominator you should try to convey is that practice has to be regular and consistent.</p><br><p><strong>3) Wait for mastery</strong><br><br>I don&#8217;t know about you, but especially at the start of lessons I am always tempted to teach a lot of new material each lesson because it makes both the child and parent feel like they are accomplishing something and making progress right away. I have to think of the greater picture though and know that I am inhibiting their future success by skimming through important foundational skills. Only introduce new material after the prior has been mastered. If it helps, an overview of my first lesson with a young child includes: reviewing the Suzuki method of teaching with the parent, learning finger numbers on both hands (since I do not tell the child what letter to play on the piano but instead what finger number to push), finding all of the C&#8217;s on the piano (since that is the starting position for all of the beginning songs in the Suzuki book), and if time learning simple song(s) on the black keys for fun. I ask the child what their favorite animal or food is an make up a song about it. If the child chooses lion as their favorite animal an example would be to have them play fingers 2-3-4 saying &#8220;Lions roar&#8221; on the 3 black keys. This is a silly game for the child but also a way to start to develop finger independence and review finger numbers.</p><br><p><strong>4) Recognize success</strong><br><br>As with language, the child’s effort to learn an instrument should be met with sincere praise and encouragement. By nature I am extremely encouraging to the children, always clapping for them and offering high praise. I&#8217;ve learned over the years though that there is a fine line with being super encouraging and not pushing a child to try their hardest, knowing that I will give them praise either way. Our attitude in lessons does make a giant difference to a child.  Many of the children I work with get upset if they feel I am not proud of them.  Even though every child learns at a difference pace, they need to feel that we recognize their successes, big or small.</p><br><p><strong>5) Always foster a love for music</strong><br><br>I want my students to have a love music and try my hardest to remind them of this fact consistently. When I find a student getting frustrated, I take a step back and remind them that music is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. Even though we all get overwhelmed from time to time, music is one of the greatest joys in life.  I never want them to forget this.</p><br><p>I hope this series on the Suzuki piano method has been helpful to you.  Write down a comment or send an email if you&#8217;d like any more information or have questions.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

Today I will provide an overview of the Suzuki piano method.  The overall philosophy of Suzuki instruction embraces an early immersion in instrument study without exposure to note-reading.</p><br><p style="color: #000000;">The traditional Suzuki method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Shinichi Suzuki, a Japanese violinist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of World War II.   Originally the Suzuki method applied only to violin instruction. It has since moved to encompass many other instruments.  These include:  violin, viola, cello, piano, bass, flute, recorder, guitar, harp, voice, organ, mandolin, and trumpet.  We will focus on piano.</p><br><p style="color: #000000;"><strong>One of the main techniques of learning with the Suzuki method is having the students listen to recordings of their music to the point of saturation.</strong> The child listens to pieces he is playing and basically copies the melody, tempo, phrasing, etc.  Internationally renowned recording artist Seizo Azuma began his piano study in Japan with the Suzuki Piano School method.  Mr. Azuma is the recording artist for the Suzuki Piano School New International Edition. As an assistant professor, he currently teaches younger pianists at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music.</p><br><p style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tonalization</strong> is a term coined by Suzuki, and is deliberately similar to the word &#8220;vocalization&#8221; (as it is used by singers when they talk about warming up their voices). Tonalization is defined as the student&#8217;s ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments such as the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music (Lavie, Karen, New Zealand Suzuki Journal, 2005).</span></p><br><p><strong>Parent participation </strong>is vital in the success of a child learning with the Suzuki method.  The mom or dad are required to be in the lessons so they can provide a solid support system at home.  If a child forget what he/she has learned in the lesson, a parent then becomes a home teacher and guides their child.  In my studio, children never read the book even though it has finger numbers written in.  I always tell them that they are &#8220;cheating&#8221; themselves by doing so.  If they have forgotten what I taught in their lesson, the first step I tell my students is to listen to the recording.  If that is unsuccessful, ask the parent for help.</p><br><p><b>A positive environment </b>is what Suzuki believed would help to foster character in students.  He often spoke of the ability of all children to learn things well, especially in the right environment, and of developing the heart and building the character of music students through their music education.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993366;"><em>&#8220;Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens, noble human beings. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth, and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets beautiful heart.&#8221;  <span style="color: #993366;">Shinichi Suzuki</span></em></span></p><br><p>Many people fault the Suzuki method, claiming note-reading is too far delayed.  They believe that if a child relied on copying the teacher or parent during his formative years of study, there was no particular motivation to read music.  This is a valid point.  Because of that, I sway a bit from the purest and teach reading slowly to my students so they are not at a disadvantage.   Depending on the student, I typically do an 80/20 split during lessons of Suzuki/reading and find that most transition to note reading without any problems later in their music training.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p style="color: #000000;">The traditional Suzuki method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Shinichi Suzuki, a Japanese violinist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of World War II.   Before his time, it was rare for children to be formally taught classical instruments from an early age and even more rare for children to be accepted by a music teacher without an audition. Shinichi had a different philosophy and did not screen children based upon their ability for entrance to his music school in Matsumoto, Japan. <span style="color: #252525;">His major aim was to open a world of beauty to young children everywhere that they might have greater enjoyment in their lives through the God-given sounds of music (Hermann, 1971).</span></p><p></p>
<p></p><p style="color: #000000;">Born in Nagoya, Japan in 1898, as one of twelve children, Shinichi spent his childhood working at his father&#8217;s violin factory putting up violin soundposts. He began to teach himself how to play the violin in 1916 after being inspired by a recording of Mischa Elman. Without access to professional instruction, he listened to recordings and tried to imitate what he heard.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p style="color: #252525;">At the age of 26, Marquis Tokugawa, a friend of <span style="color: #000000;">Shinichi</span>, persuaded his father to allow him to study in Germany, where he studied under Karl Klingler. While in Germany, he spent time under the guardianship of Albert Einstein and  married his wife, Waltraud Prange (1905–2000). Upon his return to Japan, <span style="color: #000000;">Shinichi</span> formed a string quartet with his brothers and began teaching at the Imperial School of Music and at the Kunitachi Music School in Tokyo.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p style="color: #252525;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shinichi </span>started to take interest in developing the music education of young students in violin during and after World War II. Once the war was over, he was invited to teach at a new music school being formed, and agreed to the position with the condition he would be allowed to develop teaching music to children from infancy and early childhood.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p style="color: #252525; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993366;"><em>&#8220;My dream is for the happiness of all children. I feel respect and friendly feelings for everyone. In particular, I cannot help but feel respect and warm feelings for young children. And my heart brims over with a desire to help make all the children born upon the earth fine human beings, happy people, people of superior ability. My whole life energies are devoted to this end.&#8221; Shinichi Suzuki</em></span></p><p></p>
<p></p><p style="color: #252525;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shinichi Suzuki died at his home in Matsumoto, Japan on 26 January 1998, aged 99.  Among his accolades, Shinichi was responsible for the early training of some of the earliest Japanese violinists to be successfully appointed to prominent western classical music organizations.  He received several honorary doctorates in music from the New England Conservatory of Music (1966), University of Louisville (1967), University of Rochester Eastman School of Music (1972), Oberlin College Conservatory of Music (1984) and the Cleveland Institute of Music (1990).  Shinichi Suzuki was proclaimed a Living National Treasure of Japan and was nominated for the Nobel Peace prize in 1993. </span></p><p></p>

In case you aren&#8217;t familiar with this style of teaching, the philosophy of Suzuki instruction is to embrace an early immersion in an instrument study without exposure to note-reading initially. Students can begin to play instruments beautifully even at a very early age.</p><br><p>This blog post is the first in a four part series discussing the benefits of Suzuki piano. Part one will examine the importance of music training and the role it plays in brain development. <a href="http://musicalbridges.com/?p=1642" target="_blank">Part two</a> will give a short biography of <span style="color: #000000;">Shinichi Suzuki. </span><a href="http://musicalbridges.com/?p=1624" target="_blank">Part three</a> will provide an overview of the Suzuki piano method.  Lastly, <a href="http://musicalbridges.com/?p=1659" target="_blank">part four</a> will cover specific tips and tricks to help the teacher be more effective.</p><br><p>There are many benefits derived from studying a musical instrument. These benefits are in a wide range of areas including personal development, intellectual development, and social development.</p><br><p>Below is a list of reasons why a musical education will benefit your child.</p><br><p><strong>Personal Development:</strong></p><br><p>Self confidence<br><br>Self discipline<br><br>Poise and confidence</p><br><p><strong>Intellectual Development (increased brain development in the areas of):</strong></p><br><p>Language<br><br>Reasoning<br><br>Spatial intelligence<br><br>Creativity<br><br>Problem solving<br><br>Improved academic performance<br><br>Memory</p><br><p><strong>Social Development:</strong></p><br><p>Enhances teamwork skills and discipline<br><br>Provides a means of self-expression<br><br>Wholesome entertainment for the student and friends at any age<br><br>It is fun to be with like minded peers</p>

For the past nine months, Hiyam has been fighting the disease with a mix of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, administered at the Sydney Children&#8217;s Hospital in Randwick.  Staff from the hospital&#8217;s Play and Music Therapy Department have worked with Hiyam since November to help prepare her for the procedures and treatment involved.</p><br><p>Matt Ralph is the Music Therapist that works alongside Play therapist Kylie Estreich. Ms. Estreich says &#8220;as for how play and music therapy differs from other forms of treatment, the focus of the medical team is on the illness, while her department focuses on the child. We don&#8217;t differentiate between their conditions. We look at what they can do and empower them.&#8221; Matt speaks to the same idea as well, saying &#8220;we try and give [the patients] an opportunity to express themselves and have a bit of fun as well as create things they may not have thought they could do. The one thing you want to see on a daily basis as many times as you can; you want to see kids smiling and expressing themselves, because at some point they&#8217;re going to leave the hospital.You want them to leave as strong and positive and enjoying life and looking forward to the future, as much as they can. That&#8217;s exactly where music and play steps in.&#8221;</p><br><p>Hiyam&#8217;s mother Yesmin is in full support of Music Therapy for her daughter. In an interview she said, &#8220;the first thing we wanted to do, as soon as we found out, was to be positive. I just want her to know that she is beautiful; to always have confidence.&#8221;</p><br><p>Music therapy has the amazing ability to give confidence to children and adults, no matter their diagnosis. As patients engage in the music making process it provokes positive responses due to the familiarity, predicability, and feeling of security associated with it. Music therapy can help with pain and anxiety as well as help the patient express themselves emotionally and process their stay in the hospital.</p><br><p>I love hearing success stories of music therapists working in all fields, including cancer patients. I believe in music therapy and it&#8217;s healing powers and know we are making a difference in the world.</p>

One of our favorite songs involves using an ocean drum while we sing an adapted version of <em>All The Fish Are Swimming in the Water </em>by <span style="color: #000000;">Jackie Silberg.  I show the children an ocean drum which is full of different sizes and colors of fish along with sea shells and crabs.  Taking turns, one child picks the fish he/she wants to sing about inside the drum.  Using the words below as a base, we choose what size and color fish will be incorporated into our song.  Whenever we sing &#8220;splash,&#8221; the children get to shake the drum quickly and loudly, making it sound just like ocean waves.  This provides a very unique sensory experience for the children.  I hope you&#8217;ll give it a try!   </span></p><br><p class="style3" style="color: #000000;">Recite this verse in a slow, low voice, with large, exaggerated motions:</p><br><p class="style3" style="color: #000000;">The great big fish is swimming in the water<br><br>Swimming in the water<br><br>Swimming in the water<br><br>The great big fish is swimming in the water<br><br>Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble&#8230;SPLASH!</p><br><p class="style12" style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;" align="left">This verse is chanted in a high, squeaky voice, with little motions:</p><br><p class="style3" style="color: #000000;">The little bitty fish are swimming in the water<br><br>Swimming in the water<br><br>Swimming in the water<br><br>The little bitty fish are swimming in the water<br><br>Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble&#8230;SPLASH!</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>
