<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I had a blog when WordPress came out in 2003. I thought it was cool, but continued using HTML (and a little bit of Frontpage occasionally since I&#8217;m not a designer). I paid attention to WordPress through the years and watched it &#8216;grow up.&#8217; More and more clients started asking me to help them with their WP sites and more and more designers hired me to fix or modify plugins and/or themes since I&#8217;m a programmer first and foremost. Once I saw how awesome WordPress can be for the whole site (sometime around 2012), I began using it exclusively to build new websites.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like that it can be customized to do anything we can dream up. I love that it&#8217;s open source. I love the community surrounding WordPress. I love that it&#8217;s easy enough for my kids to use and yet sophisticated enough for most any website or web application. I love that there are practically a billion themes out there that are easily accessible and available so that my clients, regardless of budget, can get a website.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I mostly build web applications with WP or customize plugins and themes for my clients. In addition, I host and protect WP sites for my clients who don&#8217;t want to worry about their sites getting hacked. Unfortunately, I also fix a lot of WP sites who didn&#8217;t have any protection and therefore, have been broken into. It definitely pays to have protection.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>The WP community has helped me to learn about new plugins, themes, services and tools available to the WP community that I might not otherwise know about. I meet with other developers and discuss how we have solved certain problems using WP. I&#8217;ve also called upon other WP developers, and been called upon, to help out with business logic, tools or solutions.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>WordPress has increased my bottom line substantially through my security and protection services. It&#8217;s also made development much faster. I&#8217;ve met many Designers, whom I wouldn&#8217;t have met otherwise, because they&#8217;ve needed help customizing or extending WordPress. WordPress is a wonderful tool that anyone can use to build a website and seems to be very popular with designers because it doesn&#8217;t require them to learn much about coding and development. But, when they do need help, they often call me.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>I would tell a brand new user to make sure they have good hosting, good backups, good security, and update, update, update! WordPress is open source, meaning that everyone, including those who aren&#8217;t so friendly, can find the security holes in themes, plugins and the core code. When those security holes are patched, they are announced to the world, which gives hackers the specifics they need to break into WP sites more easily unless the sites are updated almost immediately. Update and backup everything often.</p><br><p>I would tell new developers, you made the right choice! Get involved with the community and never stop learning!</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>I love teaching and training and often have about 5 to 10 interns and/or junior programmers working with me in my business. It helps them get the experience they need to get a job (unless I keep them 😉 ) and helps my clients get more affordable help with their sites. I think it works well for all of us.</p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>Seven years ago, I needed a website built fast and my sister-in-law, who lived in Birmingham, invited me to a WordCamp. I learned a lot fast and next thing you know, I started making a living using WordPress.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like that there is a small barrier to entry to use the platform. If you don&#8217;t know a lot or any code, you can still use it. This creates a large worldwide user base.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I run Ah So Designs, a local WordPress development company. I no longer develop websites for our company. I focus on business development within WordPress and UI/UX design.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>Five or so years ago, I saw Randy (Hicks) at a local coffee shop and we started WP Nashville. The community has been great! I&#8217;ve learned a lot through others and have made most of my employee hires from people I&#8217;ve met within the community.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>I quit my corporate job, married a beautiful woman, got a dog named Dunn, and now help run a WordPress company. None, well besides the dog, would have been possible without WordPress. I&#8217;d like to say my wife married my because I am incredibly good looking, but let&#8217;s be realistic, she really likes to watch me make websites because she likes dorks <img src="https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2015/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"></p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>Play with WordPress and have fun! When it stops being fun, hire a professional who is fun.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should know?</strong><br><br>I&#8217;ve got friends in low places…</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/%20" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>A friend in 2007 mentioned WordPress and that I could build websites with it. I jumped on board and haven&#8217;t looked back since.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like that it has a vibrant community that continues to stay on top of web standards. I also like that it&#8217;s an open source project. WordPress has helped more people publish to the web than probably any software out there.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I develop custom sites and applications.</p><br><p><strong>How as the WP community helped you?</strong><br><br>The local community has pulled me out of the home office! I now have a over a dozen developer friends I could contact at any point to ask questions. I&#8217;m convinced that I could move to any city that has a WordPress meetup and run a successful business. The WordPress community is such an all inclusive group that I feel included everywhere!</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Learning to code php changed my day job, but using WP as the engine behind my php boosted me out of manual labor.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a new user? A new developer?</strong><br><br>Take the plunge! Start simple, join the meetup group and come out to all the meetings. Building a site whether it&#8217;s a blog or a professional product is very rewarding and WordPress makes it easy and forward compatible!</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/%20" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I wanted a blog to add on to my photography business&#8217; website, and slowly discovered that WordPress could be much more than just a blog.</p><br><p><strong> What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like that WordPress can accommodate anything I can dream up, if I can implement it. What I love most about WordPress is the community&#8211;not only have I been able to find countless answers online because others have shared their solutions, but I&#8217;ve also been able to personally connect with developers and users worldwide.</p><br><p><strong> What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I build custom websites for small businesses, nonprofits, and individuals. I also build some plugins.</p><br><p><strong> How has the WP community (local and beyond) helped you?</strong><br><br>In general, the WordPress community&#8217;s commitment to sharing knowledge online through forums, blogs, and articles has allowed me to find answers to my questions much more rapidly than I could on my own. I&#8217;ve also been able to connect with users around the world who enjoy working together, discussing, and helping each other solve problems and create new solutions.</p><br><p><strong> Did learning WP lead to any significant professional, personal, creative changes in your life?</strong><br><br>I&#8217;ve been able to build my business on WordPress, which is pretty awesome.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a brand new user?</strong><br><br>Don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment and try things. WordPress is surprisingly difficult to break!</p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I stumbled across WordPress while learning front end development in 2008. I was looking for a way to go beyond static html and give my clients the ability to edit content without my needing to edit the code—WordPress was the perfect solution.</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I love that the barrier to entry is low for WordPress. They&#8217;ve made it easy for people to jump in and start creating their own plugins and themes. On top of that, the community is so vast and established that there is a plugin or tutorial for pretty much anything you&#8217;d ever want to do to your WordPress site. And, because it&#8217;s open source, everyone can build on each other&#8217;s ideas and contribute back to the community.</p><br><p><strong> What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I&#8217;m building an <a title="Jetty" href="http://jettyapp.com" target="_blank">enterprise web application</a> on top of it. We&#8217;ve created a highly customized version of the WP Dashboard using WP-API, Backbone.js, and a whole lot of CSS.</p><br><p><strong> How has the WP community (local and beyond) helped you?</strong><br><br>When I started out, the global community was my greatest resources for learning WordPress. I spent hours watching and reading tutorials, dissecting plugins and themes, and pouring through forums and StackOverflow posts. If I couldn&#8217;t figure something out by Googling, I could post my question to the community and I&#8217;d always have people willing to help. Since moving back to Nashville last fall after being away for 7 years, I decided to start getting involved in the local community. The WPNashville meetup group was super welcoming. It&#8217;s been awesome hanging out with people who love WordPress and geek out over web stuff as much as I do.</p><br><p><strong> Did learning WP lead to any significant professional, personal, creative changes in your life?</strong><br><br>If I hadn&#8217;t learned WordPress, I wouldn&#8217;t have the career I have now. Every job I&#8217;ve gotten since learning WP has been a result of having WP experience. I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as saying I owe my life to WordPress, but I may consider naming my first born Mullenweg.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a brand new user?</strong><br><br>Two things: 1. Don&#8217;t be afraid to jump in a break things in order to learn how they work. This is a great way to get started. 2. Become a part of the community. Attend your local meetup, or start one if there isn&#8217;t one nearby. You&#8217;ll grow so much faster as part of a group.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should we know?</strong><br><br>I have 7 years of show choir experience. You know that show Glee? That was basically my life in high school and college.</p>

<p><strong>How were you first introduced to WordPress?</strong><br><br>I was introduced to WordPress 4 years ago. I created a website to help college students with homework. I have created 20+ WordPress websites since then (it&#8217;s sort of part of my job).</p><br><p><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br><br>I like how easy it is to set up. I&#8217;ve been creating websites since 2004, and back then it was all HTML and CSS by hand. I still have to get in the back end here and there, but for the most part, I don&#8217;t have to worry about the coding. I can focus more on driving results for my business rather than writing code.</p><br><p><strong>What do you do with WP now?</strong><br><br>I have my own business, MarketRiser, which I use WordPress on. All clients that I have built websites for are on WordPress. I also do SEO professionally, so I jump into WordPress on a daily basis.</p><br><p><strong>How has the WP community (local and beyond) helped you?</strong><br><br>Wordpress Codex has definitely been a life saver. The forums on the WordPress website are very helpful as well. Early on using WordPress, it&#8217;s easy to be totally confused on simple things like setting up a child theme. The WP community is more than helpful on solving any problems I have.</p><br><p><strong>Did learning WP lead to any significant professional, personal, creative changes in your life?</strong><br><br>Wordpress allowed me to build websites a lot faster than coding HTML, which led to being able to generate more money. WordPress now allows me to host my website where I generate a small amount of affiliate income.</p><br><p><strong>What would you tell a brand new user?</strong><br><br>Don&#8217;t get plugin happy. Plugins are essential for a WordPress site, but it&#8217;s easy to install every &#8220;bright shiny object.&#8221; For any website you have, no matter what it is, set up an opt-in form to gain subscribers to your email list. This goes beyond just WordPress because you have to have an email marketing provider, but it&#8217;s so essential for every website and business to have an email list. Pro tip: get a plugin like Visual Composer to create pages in a drag and drop format. It saves a TON of headaches.</p><br><p><strong>Anything else we should we know?</strong><br><br>I&#8217;m a husband and a father of 4 kids. My favorite quote, &#8220;Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.&#8221; -Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><br><p><strong><a title="faces-of-wordpress" href="http://wpnashville.com/community/form-faces-of-wordpress/" target="_blank">BECOME A FACE OF WORDPRESS</a></strong></p>
