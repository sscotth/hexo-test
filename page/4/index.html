<p></p><p>It&#8217;s getting to be that time of year where I get to sing all of my snow and winter weather songs.  A favorite of the kids I work with involves penguins.  We love waddling around like penguins and trying to make their unique sounds.  One game I created teaches the children how an Emperor Penguin incubates an egg.  The male penguin cradles the egg on top of his feet and covers it with a pouch of skin for 65 days!</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>While listening to the &#8220;March of the Penguins&#8221; march by Alex Wurman, we take playdoh and place it on top of our feet pretending it&#8217;s an egg that the daddy penguin carries.  If you give this a try you&#8217;ll see just how challenging balancing an &#8220;egg&#8221; on top our your feet can be. But we have such a great time waddling around and protecting our baby eggs.  I like to quiz the children as we go along with basic questions about penguins.  For example:  where do they live, is it hot or cold there, what food they eat, etc.</p><p></p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Rapper Amkoullel</p><br><br><p>I found a disheartening story today from NPR news about music in the city of Timbuktu that was published on 1/8/13.  I never knew this place actually existed since phrases like &#8220;from here to Timbuktu&#8221; and &#8220;as far away as Timbuktu&#8221; are so prevalent in society today. Timbuktu is a town in the West African nation of Mali situated north of the River Niger and on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert   See a map <a title="Mali" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=timbuktu" target="_blank">here </a>if you&#8217;re interested (or don&#8217;t believe me!)</p><br><p>The man pictured is 33-yr old Rapper Amkoullel who sings about self-image, immigration and respect.  He&#8217;s played all over the world but caught the attention of authorities last year.  Concerned about the Islamic insurgency already underway in the north, he created an association called Plus Jamais Ca, French for &#8220;never again.&#8221;  Amkoullel recorded the song &#8220;SOS&#8221; that declares Mali is in a state of emergency and it was banned by Mali&#8217;s government.</p><br><p>Militants linked to al-Qaida have long been a threat in the north <a title="Original article from NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/2013/01/08/168882594/despite-censorship-malis-musicians-play-on" target="_blank">according to the article</a>. After the coup in the capital, the militants took advantage of the country&#8217;s chaos and took control in all of the north.  <strong>The al-Qaida-linked militants have banned music of any kind, even cellphone ringtones</strong>, and have also put an end to the Festival in the Desert, which had been held for the past decade near Timbuktu.</p><br><p>As a musician I cannot imagine what life would be like is music was banned, even for a week.  In the course of a day I use live and recorded music in all of my sessions and lessons, listen to my iPod working out, practice piano at night, and often go to sleep listening to relaxing music.</p><br><p>We all know the most important things human needs for survival: clothing, shelter, some sort of language, communication with each other, belief systems, and so on. But did you know we also need music?  I believe music affects everything. It triggers emotions such as happiness and sadness. Music can comfort and make you realize that you&#8217;re not alone and you&#8217;re not the only one feeling the way you do&#8211;be it happy, sad, anxious, overwhelmed, depressed, ecstatic, etc.   .</p><br><p>A man named Ansar who lives in TImbuktu had this to say:  &#8220;We can&#8217;t fight with gun against them. For me, our only way to fight is to fight by culture, by music.&#8221;  We&#8217;re blessed to have the ability to create and use music every day.  I hope you and I never forget that.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

With each passing year it seems time flies by even faster.  Every year around this time people tend to make goals or resolutions of what they&#8217;d like to change or advance in throughout the coming year.  Common goals include self improvement, weight loss, money matters, and relationships.  However, according to <a title="Statistic Brain" href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/" target="_blank">Statistic Brain</a> only 8% of people are actually successful in achieving their resolutions.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>I’m excited about the start of a brand new year. There is so much to look forward to in 2013; so much, in fact, that I decided not to overwhelm myself with any HUGE goals or resolutions. I&#8217;m one of the crazy ones- I know!  In 2013 I am making a promise to myself and you to set an example in productivity, creativity, and progress in both my work and personal life.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>If I were to wish for anything for us both, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of potential &#8212; for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Life comes only one time so live life to the fullest and enjoy every moment. Happy New Year!</p><p></p>

It included such titles as &#8220;Ring Around the Rosie,&#8221; &#8220;Baa Baa Black Sheep,&#8221; &#8220;Muffin Man,&#8221; &#8220;Twinkle Twinkle,&#8221; &#8220;Eensy Weensy Spider,&#8221; and &#8220;Mary Had a Little Lamb.&#8221;  Isn&#8217;t it amazing how the songs we grew up singing as children are still around and popular today?  It makes me wonder what is so special about these songs that they continue generation after generation.</p><br><p>When children grow up, they take their parents’ places, their roles and their values. For example, notice how aging Boomers still tend to listen to the same music they listened to when they were sixteen. Even though there are divisions between particular generations, people generally identify themselves with a particular taste in music.  Children hold the key to our music future. I&#8217;m so glad I get to work with these young ones every day to help them continue the legacies of the generations before me.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>

Kiff Gallagher from the Center for Music National Services says that: &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely been shown that music can make a positive impact on people suffering from early-onset dementia, kids with autism, with veterans who are coming back and trying to learn to walk without a limb.&#8221;</p><br><p><a title="PBS Newshour" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june12/musictherapy_02-27.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Watch the video online</a> to get more insight into Giffords&#8217; recovery and the healing power of music therapy.</p>

So it thought it fitting to share a Thanksgiving song my preschoolers ask for year after year&#8211;The Turkey Strut. The premise of this song is simple. We all pretend to be turkeys, using our arms as wings and saying &#8220;gooble, gooble, gooble.&#8221; The children and I sing about daddy turkeys (low-pitched voice), baby turkeys (high-pitched voice), even fast, slow, silly, hopping turkeys, etc. This song is always a hit with children and is an excellent way to begin developing pretend play with them. If you want to emphasize motor skills, place homemade turkey footprints on the ground and have the children jump from each footprint to another while pretending to be turkeys. Here&#8217;s a <a title="Turkey footprint" href="http://www.musicalbridges.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Turkey-footprint.png" target="_blank" rel="external">copy of a footprint you can print and customize.</a></p>

<div>So I get this question ALL THE TIME.  Basically anyone who meets me asks for an explanation of what exactly I do as a music therapist.  I&#8217;ve found that most people think that we are music teachers or therapists who like to turn on music during their sessions.</div><br><div></div><br><div></div><br><div>As a music therapist, I work with a variety of clientele, tailoring my activities to reach individualized non-musical goals.  By that I mean social skills, motor skills, behavior challenges, speech, and more.  What we don&#8217;t do is teach a person to play an instrument, but what we do use singing, instruments, and games&#8230;..I have yet to meet a person who does not like at least one form of music.</div><br><div></div><br><div></div><br><div>Because music is such an integral part of our society, incorporating a person&#8217;s music tastes allows them to not always feel like they are &#8220;working&#8221; in a therapy session.  Instead, they feel we are playing and having a great time&#8230;.which we do!An excellent example is of an older adult I worked with at a rehabilitation hospital.  The physical therapists worked with this adult to stretch and extend her arms by doing 30 repetitions at a time.  This got very tiresome and the adult was not very motivated to participate in the physical therapy sessions.  Bringing her into music therapy, I was able to incorporate her favorite music (Elvis) working on the same physical therapy requirements.  As I played Elvis on my guitar, an assistant helped her play a drum that was extended far from her body.  This adult had a great time helping me play her Elvis songs, and said afterwards that she didn&#8217;t realize she was working her arms out until after our session when she was a bit sore!</div><br><div></div><br><div></div><br><div>Music therapy takes a different form with each person&#8217;s unique gifts and challenges.  The wonderful thing about my profession is that there&#8217;s always a new challenge but also the amazing knowledge that I am using my God-given gifts to bless others.</div>
